CET
===
CET, also called Canadian Epidemic Tracker was a University project for Software Engineering. The purpose was to create a program which can keep track of current epidemics in Canada. The Software was written in C++ and Qt4. 

I created the whole user interface and most of the backend and data classes. 

Todo:
Make it compile with the Marble project from KDE.
